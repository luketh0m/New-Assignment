Feature: Forum post
  As a logged in user
  I want to be able to create a new thread post on the CSA
  So that other CSA users can reply to my post

  Scenario: Create a thread post
    Given that user "admin" with password "taliesin" has logged in
    When the user creates a new anonymous thread with the title "Assignment help" with the body "I need help"
    Then the current page should contain a new row containing the data:
      | Title           | Author    | Unread posts | Total number of posts |
      | Assignment help | anonymous | 0            | 1                  |
